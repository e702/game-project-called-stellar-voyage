            <h1>Near Future Goals:</h1>
            <p>The ship will have thruster effects similar to the comets effects.</p>
            <p>The ship will burn fuel while the forward and backward keys are held.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a power system may also be implemented.</p>
            <p>A background image may also be added to break up the monotony of space.</p>
            <p>The title screen will be revamped. I have a really cool design in mind.</p>
            <h1>Level Generation:</h1>
            <p>The player can go to a separate level of the planet they have landed their ship on.</p>
            <p>The ship will have a warp drive to travel to different stars, each with their own planets.</p>
            <p>The player will start in a hardcoded solar system, mainly to make sure they don't get softlocked when they start playing.</p>
            <p>The player character will have its own unique design, similar to a moth.</p>
            <h1>Industry:</h1>
            <p>Planet levels can be transformed and built upon by the player character.</p>
            <p>The player can construct factories and mines to extract and process resources.</p>
            <p>The warp drive may be produced using such factories, as well as things like fuel.</p>
            <p>Comets will also have unique resources that can be obtained in the space level.</p>
            <p>Planet levels visited by the player will save and load each time they visit.</p>
